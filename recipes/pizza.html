    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, made with an oven-baked, flat, generally round bread that is often covered
        with tomatoes or a tomato-based sauce and mozzarella cheese. Other toppings are added according to region,
        culture, or personal preference. Originating as a part of Italian cuisine, the dish has become popular in many
        different parts of the world, particularly the United States, where numerous varieties have been developed,
        pizza restaurant chains have flourished, and pizza has become a home delivery item as well as being available as
        a frozen food ready to bake at home.
    </p>
    <p>Today, pizza is a symbol of several cultures: Italians, particularly from Naples, are proud of authentic pizza
        made with local ingredients and following strict guidelines for preparation. In the United States, pizza has
        iconic status as a typical American food, quickly prepared and readily available, and enjoyed by people of all
        ages at social occasions as well as family meals. The different styles, from places such as New York City and
        Chicago, reflect the diversity of American culture. Countries throughout the world have adopted pizza as a
        favorite food, adding their own variations to make this dish their own.</p>
    <p>Delicious and relatively nutritious, particularly when topped with fresh vegetables, pizza is an example of human
        creativity. Items available to the general public are combined to make something that satisfies people's needs.
        Its adaptability reflects the endless diversity of human life and culture, which then acts as a never-ending
        source of happiness.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Pizza Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>355 ml warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 active dry yeast</li>
        <li>490g bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pizza and toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese shredded</li>
        <li>Other cheese & toppings of your choice</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Proof the yeast</li>
    <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
        <br>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>
    <li>Knead the dough</li>
    <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.<br>
         Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.<br> 
        If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.<br>
        The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</p>
    <li>Let the dough rise</li>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil
        <br>At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.
        <br>Cover the dough with plastic wrap.</p>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
    <li>Prep your toppings</li>
    <li>Roll our your dough to your desired size</li>
    <li>Brush the dough with olive oil</li>
    <li>Spread tomato sauce</li>
    <li>Sprinkle mozzarella over your dough</li>
    <li>Add your toppings on top</li>
    <li>Put pizza in the oven</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes</li>
    </ol>
