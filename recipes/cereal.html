    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Breakfast cereal is a breakfast food made from processed cereal grains. It is traditionally eaten as part of
        breakfast, or a snack food, primarily in Western societies.</p>
    <p>Although warm cereals like oatmeal and grits have the longest history, ready-to-eat cold cereals appeared around
        the late 19th century and are most often served with dairy products, traditionally cow's milk. They can also be
        paired with yogurt or plant-based milks, or eaten plain. Fruit or nuts are sometimes added. Many cereals are
        produced via extrusion.
